            <p id="about strokes">
              Competitive swimming is one of the most popular olympic sports. With 4 main strokes,<i>butterfly</i>, <i>backstroke</i>, <i>breastroke</i> and <i>freestyle</i>.
			  Within each stroke there are many varied distanced events including my personal favourite the 200m <i>breastroke</i>, <strong>one of the most difficult
			 races in my opinion.</strong>

                        Here is <i>Tom Shields</i> an American swimmer who swims for the <i>University of California, Berkeley.</i>
						In 2016, Shields placed second in the 200m <i>butterfly</i> at the US Olympic Swimming Trials.

                <p>
                    <i>Butterfly</i> is by far the most exciting stroke to see in competiton, but considered difficult to perform by many due to 
				   its excessive use of core strength. This is also the stroke dominated by <i>Michael Phelps</i> in international competitive swimmming.

                        Here is a snapshot of the 200m <i>Breastroke</i> final at the <i>Rio</i> 2016 Olympics, <b>a memorable race.</b>

				<p>
                   <i>Breastroke</i> is the least popular of all the four strokes in the sport. <strong>It is very difficult to properly perform,</strong> currently there are
				   roughly 30 men on the planet who have gone under the minute in long course 100m <i>breastroke</i> races. <i>Adam Peaty</i> the British olympian is currently No.1
				   in the world in the 100m <i>Breastroke</i>, and still continues to <b>smash</b> world records at <b>major</b> international competitons

                <p>
                    <i>Backstroke</i> is a stroke known by many swimmers for its <b>strenuousness</b> in execution, the complexity of the start and turns make
					this a <b>fearful</b> stroke to race in, as so many aspects of the race can go wrong.

                    <i>Freestyle</i> is the most popular of the 4 strokes, and is by far among the most competitive with new names constantly taking new 
					titles throughout international competitions. It is the <strong>fastest of the four strokes</strong> with the current world record in the 100m <i>freesttyle</i>
					being held by Brazilian swimmer <i>CÃ©sar Cielo.</i>
