					He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired and was sentenced to <em>serve 18 months' probation</em>, photos of the man using a <em>bong</em> in february 2009 also surfaced damaging his image as an athlete.
					But regardless of these faults <i>Phelps</i> still ended his career with a <em>bang</em> in the <em>Rio 2016 Olympics.</em>
