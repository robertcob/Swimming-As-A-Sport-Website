				<p> Starting at the age of 12, numerous morning and evening training sessions became second nature to me. Throughout my competitive relationship with the sport,
					I received a bronze medal in the 1500m freestyle, and 2 gold medals in the 100m and 200m breastroke, at the Irish Age Groups.

				<p> Killarney Swimming Club was founded recently in the year 2012, with a small base of competitive swimming experience. But two years later already had swimmers competing at national
					level, which surprised many due to the open knowledge that swimming had no tradition in the county of kerry.
